# AI Business Card

## Project Description
Our Project is to design and build an intelligent AR Business Card. We will be using Watson Conversations to build a chatbot that guides the user through a conversation about John McNamara, a Senior Inventor and Innovation Centre Technologist Lead at IBM.

The app will allow the user to point their camara at the physical business card. An AR avatar will then appear on top of the card and begin a conversation with the user. The user can then speak to the avatar about John's career, his current role, his interests, and his employers, IBM.
